# Leaflet and OpenStreetMap Routing

This is a simple web application that demonstrates how to calculate routes between two points using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap.

## Description

This application allows users to click on the map to set their start and end points, and calculates the route between the two points. It uses the Leaflet JavaScript library to display the map and the OpenStreetMap routing machine to calculate the route.

## Usage

To use this application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Click on the map to set your start and end points, and the route between the two points will be automatically calculated and displayed in detail.

Here are some helpful tips to get you started:

-   Click on the map to set your start point. A marker will appear indicating your start location.
-   Click on the map again to set your end point. A marker will appear indicating your end location, and the route between the two points will be calculated and displayed.
-   If you want to change your start point, simply click on the map again to set a new start point. The end point will be cleared, and a new route will be calculated between your new start point and your previous end point.

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leaflet-routing.git
